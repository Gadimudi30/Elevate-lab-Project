# Project Title :  "Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Forecasting"
#Explanation : "Here my project aims to predict when and where Electric Vehicle(EV) charging stations will be busiest. I have combined data based on weather, traffic, and past charging activity to find patterns by merging them(datasets are 'synthetic_ev_occupancy.csv' & 'synthetic_weather.csv' files). By using Python,I have built time-series model like Prophet to forecast demand. And here I have used excel and python for cleaning and organizing the datasets before analysis(cleaned dataset is 'ev_demand_forecast.csv'). To make insights easy to understand, I have built an interactive Tableau dashboard. Here the end goal of my project is to help plan smarter charging strategies and improve EV user experience."
